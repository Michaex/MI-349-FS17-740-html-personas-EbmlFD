          To explore the unknown universe
        <h3>Ages:</h3>

        <h3>Who is it?:</h3>
        <pr>Early in life, Viktor discovered his passion for science and invention, particularly in the field of mechanical automation.
          He attended Zaun's prestigious College of Techmaturgy and led the team that constructed Blitzcrank - a scientific breakthrough that he expected to vault him to the top of his profession.
          Unfortunately his triumph was usurped by Professor Stanwick, who stole credit for developing Blitzcrank's sentience and later used Viktor's research to revive Urgot.
          Viktor's appeals for justice fell on deaf ears, and he sank into a deep depression.
          He withdrew from the College and barricaded himself in his private laboratory, cutting all human ties.
          There, in secret, he conceived a project for which nobody else could claim credit.
          Desiring both to revolutionize his field and to eliminate the jealous human emotions which festered inside him, he engineered parts to replace and improve his own body.</pr>

        <h3>What goals?:</h3>
        <pr> Now devoted to the defense of his people, Explorer is Piltover's best hope for a bright future.</pr>
